## Project Overview
- Star Wars is a popular film franchise that takes place in a galaxy far, far away. 
- This is a collection of script dialogue between characters for the first three movies (episodes 4-6). 
- Use text and sentiment analysis on the star wars scripts to discover hidden insights and sentiment between characters.
- Perform text association (network analysis) to identify relationships between words in a text and constructing a network of the linked words.
- The dataset can be obtained [here from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xvivancos/star-wars-movie-scripts).
- [RStudio(R)](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) is used to assist this project with statistical analyses by extracting important insights using: 
  - [Text Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Text_analysis&redirect=no)
  - [Data Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)
  - [Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)
  - [Text Association (Network Analysis)](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-network-analysis-a-concise-review-of-network-construction-methods-8e875108f058)



## Motivation
- Since it's a holiday (and just because Star Wars is an awesome movie), this data should serve as a fun way to implement text and sentiment analysis.
- Discover and understand what textual relationship affects the character's spoken text and feelings toward one another. 



### Aim & Objective
- Aim: 
  - To show different insights (i.e. text spoken, feelings, relationships, text association) between characters.
- Objective: 
  - Perform text analysis to understand the textual relationship between the characters.
  - Perform sentiment analysis to understand the positive or negative sentiment related to which character where certain words can lead to certain sentiments.
  - Perform text association (network analysis) to Identify the words association and relationships between characters which allows for the understanding or prediction of what will the character say next, when talking about a certain word.
